# Studend sub orbital unified telemetry handler

S²OUTH is a project developing a modern and reliable telemetry system. The goal of the system is to provide live telemetry including sensor data, and high precision pose estimation for the entire duration of a suborbital spaceshot flight. Furthermore the project includes a secondary high bandwidth RF link to stream high fidelity video of the rocket during the flight.

The project was originally conceived in collaboration with the student team from HyEnD Stuttgart for usage in their N₂ORTH hybrid propellant rocket. Since then a preliminary version of the project named South Cube has flown as payload on the Ispida rocket build by Aerospace Team Graz (ASTG) and further options for collaborations with student teams are being explored.

The N₂ORTH rocket is currently scheduled to fly in may 2026.
